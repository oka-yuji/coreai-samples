## Verification

Run the complete build and model-free checks from the repository root. These need an Apple silicon Mac with macOS 27 and Xcode 27 selected with `xcode-select`.

```bash
./check.sh
```

The script builds and tests `CoreAISamplesKit`, builds `Tools/Verify` and runs its CPU tests in Release, builds the macOS app in Release, and runs the Agent offline self-test. It clears inherited `COREAI_*`, `GLINER_*`, `DECIDE_*` and `CLEF_*` controls before these stages, so an unrelated model-test setting cannot start inference. The last line is `CHECK PASS` with exit code 0, or `CHECK FAIL: <stage>` with exit code 1.

To add language-model checks, install Python 3 for JSON result validation and supply bundle folders separated by `:`. The first bundle is also used for the official-runtime comparison and the state check; a small bundle such as Qwen3.5-0.8B keeps this check short.

```bash
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle-a:/path/to/bundle-b ./check.sh
```

This adds the model-enabled tests, two fixed prompts compared against Apple's sequential engine, and two own-runtime chat turns followed by a processed-state check. Both prompts must match every generated token and every step's logits on the matching `prefill-function` path. The two `main-only` records are retained as diagnostics because they use a different prefill path; their agreement is not a pass criterion. Missing records, reported errors and a failed state check fail the script even if the verification command exits successfully. The JSON records are saved under `.build/check/`.

The runtime and demo-app measurements use this environment:

| Component | Measured configuration |
|---|---|
| macOS | 27.0, build 26A428 |
| Xcode | 27.0, build 27A266a |
| Mac | MacBook Pro (Mac16,6), Apple M4 Max |
| Unified memory | 128 GiB (137,438,953,472 bytes) |

`Tools/Verify` is a separate Swift package and the only place that depends on Apple's `coreai-models` package, pinned to 1.0.0; the library, the CLI and the demo app do not. Its `coreai-verify` tool drives Apple's runtime (`--runtime official`, with `--engine default` or `sequential`) and this one (`--runtime own`) and prints one JSON line per measurement. In the table, "own" is this repository's runtime.

| Subcommand | What it does |
|---|---|
| `chat` | Stream several turns through one LanguageModelSession. |
| `tools` | Ask questions that may need tools; print one record per model step and one per question. |
| `bench` | Time a reload, then stream one fixed prompt three times, each in a new session. |
| `compare` | Feed the same tokens to the own engine and the official sequential engine; compare greedy tokens and logits. |
| `rewind` | Save a point after a shared preamble, generate, restore, and generate again; time a full re-read for comparison. |
| `speed` | Alternate the own engine, the official sequential engine, and the official default engine, one process each. |

`chat`, `tools` and `bench` take `--runtime` and `--engine`, plus `--context-limit` and `--drop-old-tool-outputs` for `--runtime own`.

```bash
cd Tools/Verify
swift build -c release
.build/release/coreai-verify compare --model <bundle> --max-tokens 64 --prompt "en=List three fruits, one per line."
.build/release/coreai-verify chat --model <bundle> --runtime own --max-tokens 64 --prompt "What is the capital of France? Answer with one word."
```

From the `CoreAISamplesKit` folder, `swift test` runs the tests that need no model, such as the reuse plan, the parsers, the sampler, the context fitting and the RAG passages and dates. The tests that load a model run only when `COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES` lists bundle folders, separated by `:`.

```bash
cd CoreAISamplesKit
swift test
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle-a:/path/to/bundle-b swift test
```

The model-loading tests share one serialized suite; tokenizer-only checks remain independent. Acquire the heavy-job lock described in `CLAUDE.md` before running them. `seededSamplingRepeats` compares complete generated token sequences for top-k (40) and top-p (0.95), temperature 0.8 and seed 7, with state reuse disabled. The bundle, prompt, sampling settings and prefill segmentation must match for exact reproducibility. `COREAI_SEED_REPETITIONS` changes the default 20 repetitions; use the same test with 5 repetitions for a release candidate's larger bundle.

The boundary tests render exactly 16,382, 16,383, 16,384 and 16,385 input tokens against a 16,384-token context. With either overflow policy, the first two inputs leave room for at most two and one generated tokens; the other two must throw `contextSizeExceeded` with the limit and input count. Separate histories check tool-output truncation, its metadata and irreducible overflow. State checks compare against a full reread using the eight-tick near-tie rule.

`twoSessionsShareOneModel` submits 50 pairs through one model, records overlapping executor calls, checks for the other session's marker and cancels one request after its first streamed fragment in every fifth pair. It also checks recovery and the final state. `COREAI_CONCURRENCY_PAIRS=1` selects one pair for a Thread Sanitizer run. These are opt-in checks; a skipped model test does not validate a bundle.

```bash
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle COREAI_SEED_REPETITIONS=5 swift test --filter ModelIntegrationTests.seededSamplingRepeats
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle COREAI_CONCURRENCY_PAIRS=1 swift test --sanitize=thread --filter ModelIntegrationTests.twoSessionsShareOneModel
```

The own runtime's `chat` and `tools` commands accept `--reload-interval` and `--reload-footprint-bytes`; zero disables the respective trigger. `chat --new-conversation-every 10` starts a new session after every ten prompts. Own-runtime chat records include `generated_tokens`, the complete sampled output IDs without the stop token, including the last unprocessed ID at a response limit. Failed CLI turns omit this field. The Verification SPI returns the last request admitted to execution after request-only validation: empty before decoding, complete on success, and the current partial samples on decode failure or cancellation. Request-only validation failures are rejected before the execution lock and leave the previous snapshot, processed state and conversation tracking unchanged. Framework rejection before the executor runs also leaves the snapshot unchanged. Turn and tool-step records include `reload_seconds` when present, and memory records include graphics footprint bytes (the graphics footprint ledger plus its compressed ledger). `chat --check-state` checks each reloaded turn and the final state.

```bash
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle swift test --filter ModelIntegrationTests
COREAI_TEST_BUNDLES=/path/to/bundle COREAI_TEST_RELOAD_INTERVAL=0 COREAI_TEST_RELOAD_FOOTPRINT_BYTES=1 swift test --filter ModelIntegrationTests.twoSessionsShareOneModel
```

The low-threshold concurrency run requires at least one observed reload. Model-enabled results are required in addition to the CPU policy and fake-engine tests.

For a memory-growth measurement, add `--memory-sample-turn 10 --memory-sample-turn 20 --memory-sample-turn 30` to an own-runtime `chat` command with thirty prompts. The option is off by default. At each selected turn, the original immediate `turn` record is emitted first; the same model is then kept alive without further inference for five seconds, followed by a separate `memory-sample` record with the turn number, `wait_seconds`, actual `elapsed_seconds` through the memory capture, and the usual memory fields. Any requested state check runs afterward, including the final check. Duplicate or nonexistent turn numbers are rejected before loading.

The five-second interval is a measurement convention, not a guarantee that memory has stabilized or reclamation has completed on every device. Keep the immediate values and peak alongside the delayed samples. The footprint threshold calibration still uses the maximum immediate post-turn footprint, multiplied by 1.5 and rounded up to a decimal GB. CPU-only checks for the observation option and its wait/capture behavior run with `swift test --package-path Tools/Verify`.
